There a lot of awful parts of about what is going on in the world at the moment but the idea of spending time at home with people you love and being able to wear what you want where you want, being your own boss... the feeling is oddly freeing. I think, after this when we all crawl out of our homes like vampires from being locked away from the outside world for so long, that we will all emerge from this with a new appreciation for life, for the goals and projects and ideas that can happen when there's nothing holding us back, for the friends and family and sense of community that we might have taken for granted.

I hope in six weeks, six months... however long this takes. Whenever we step back into normal society, whenever we step back outside our doors with that full sense of freedom that we are a little more productive and appreciative, more humble and a little bit more loving than we were before all this.
